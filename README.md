# ml-reference

This repo is for demo and reference notebooks on machine learning and hosts a wiki for notes. 

The ML notebook:
This is the code for the tutorial titled "Your First Machine Learning Project in Python Step-By-Step" by Jason Brownlee: 
http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/

It is kept as a starter-kit or reference for other machine learning projects. 
It involves installing necessary dependencies, using built-in quick tools for describing data, visualizing data, 
loading and reading a csv file into a pandas dataframe, and testing out different models with cross-validation.
